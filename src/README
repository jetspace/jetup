archup (http://www.nongnu.org/archup/) is a small C application which informs the user when system-updates for Archlinux are available. It's licenced under the GPLv3. In contrast to other update notifiers archup is intended to be lightweight and just do what it should: notify about possible updates.

archup uses GTk+ and libnotify to show a desktop notification if updates are available. It follows the unix-philosophy of "just doing one thing, but doing  it  well".  It just notifies about new updates but the packagedatabase has to be updated by the user (better said a cronjob). With a cronjob archup can be used to regulary check for new updates and get a desktop notification if there are some.

Please note that this is JetUp, a modified version of Archup, so please do not report any bugs to the 
original Bugtracker or the original author!
